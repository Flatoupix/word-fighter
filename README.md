# Word Fighter

[![Deploy to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/Flatoupix/word-fighter/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Flatoupix/word-fighter/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

#### The game is about entering a series of words and scoring as many points as possible.

Current version: 0.4.2

## Current Game

---

- A word is generated by default to start the game.
- The word is tested, and feedback is given if it is valid.
- Points are computed based on the number of letters entered, like Scrabble.
- If the word is a palindrome, a bonus is added.
- If the word is exactly one letter shorter or longer, Super Shrink is activated.
- If the first letter of the current word is adjacent to the first letter of the previous word, Super Suite is activated.

---

## Rules and Scoring (Reference)

---

### Game Flow

- The computer starts with a random word (local mock).
- The player enters a word; it is validated via a local rule (mock).
- If the word is valid, it appears in the list and is "typed" with animated letters.
- The score is added to the player or the computer depending on the turn.
- No end condition in the current state (continuous play).

### Score Calculation

- Letter points based on `src/assets/scrabble.json` (English distribution/values).
- Palindrome bonus: +10 if the word equals its reverse.
- Super Suite bonus: if the first letter is adjacent to the previous word's first letter.
- Super Shrink bonus: if the length differs by ±1 from the previous word.
- Initial gap bonus: alphabetical distance between first letters (current behavior).

### To Clarify for 2026

- Exact game end rules (turns, timer, target score).
- Reference dictionary and accent/variant handling.
- Precise bonus definitions (thresholds, stacking, first bonus application).
- Scrabble points consistency (FR vs EN).
- Security/format of word descriptions (HTML).
